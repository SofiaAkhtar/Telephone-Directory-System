# C++ Telephone Management System (TMS) Documentation

## Abstract

This C++ Telephone Management System (TMS) code aims to create an efficient and organized platform for managing telecommunications within an organization. The system encompasses call tracking, logging, and reporting functionalities, allowing users to monitor call data such as duration, destination, and frequency. The code also incorporates features for call accounting to track and manage expenses, promoting effective budget allocation. Security measures are implemented to monitor and control call access, ensuring the integrity of communication channels. Through this C++ TMS, the objective is to streamline communication processes, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall telecommunication management within an organizational context.

## Introduction

### Modular Design for Contact Management

The program features a modular design with distinct classes for `Contact` and `PhoneDirectory`. This modular structure enhances code organization and promotes maintainability, allowing for clear separation of concerns in contact management operations.

### User-Friendly Menu Interface

The system incorporates a user-friendly menu-driven interface, enabling users to seamlessly perform operations like adding, displaying, searching, editing, and deleting contacts. This design choice prioritizes accessibility, making the program intuitive for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

### Efficient Data Handling with CSV

The program utilizes CSV file handling for data storage and retrieval, providing an efficient mechanism for persisting contact information. This approach not only simplifies the implementation of data management but also enhances portability and compatibility with other systems or applications that support CSV formats.
